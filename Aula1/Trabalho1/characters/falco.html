    <h2>Falco</h2>
    <p>Falco is a former Nomad wheelman who was part of Maine's edgerunner crew. Shortly after Maine's death, Falco joined David's crew. After David's death, Falco became a recluse. </p>
    <p>Some time later, a certain Merc by the name of V came across a discarded braindance which mentioned David by name, warning V not to follow David's fate. Their curiosity piqued by the BD, V reached out to local fixer Muamar Reyes requesting more information, and Muamar in turn contacted Falco. Soon later, Falco contacted V personally, telling them that his crew's "15 minutes were up" and not to bother looking for them. However, recognizing the similarities between David and V, and their actions against Arasaka, Falco gave V David's jacket as a final parting gift from one Edgerunner to another. </p>
