    <h2>Gloria Martinez</h2>
    <p>Gloria and her son David lived in an apartment of Megabuilding H4 in Santo Domingo, Night City. She was an emergency medical technician (EMT) who scraped by to provide for her son, both by working long hours into the night and by selling high-priced and rare Cyberware she took off corpses to sell to edgerunners. One such instance would be the military-grade Sandevistan she took off James Norris' body after he was subdued by MaxTac. She would plastic wrap it and hide it in the inside of her coat, waiting for her buyer Maine</p>
    <p>Before she could hand the Sandevistan over, she had to pick her son David up from Arasaka Academy in Corpo Plaza after he used a jail-broken, retro wreath to try and interface with the Academy's significantly newer system, with Gloria attempting to assuage the issue David caused and promising to pay for the damages to the academy's principal.</p>
