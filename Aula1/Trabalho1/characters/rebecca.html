    <h2>Rebecca</h2>
    <p>Rebecca is a very sharp-tongued young woman, and has a tendency to be extreme and unpredictable. She is often shown going all out in fights, sometimes even laughing manically. Nevertheless, Rebecca is loyal and does everything for the crew of Maine, including supporting newcomer David where she can. </p>
    <p>Rebecca has feelings for David Martinez, as she mentions that she wasn't okay "playing just friends", and sarcastically comments to Kiwi that perhaps she should change her appearance and attitude to seem more like David's girlfriend Lucy.</p>
