    <h2>Lucyna Kushinada</h2>
    <p>Lucy is a mysterious netrunner from Night City. She is quite introverted and doesn't like to talk much about her past. Although she looks innocent, she won't hesitate to kill a person in a heartbeat if they tick her off. Lucy also considers Night City a prison, and dreams of one day leaving it for the Moon.</p>
    <p>Lucy is a young woman with naturally white hair and red-purple eyes. She wears light red eye and lip makeup. Her hair is cut in a split bob - with her left side left longer - and dyed with a colorful pastel rainbow gradient. Her eyes appear to reflect with the colors of her hair. Her style generally follows Kitsch mixed with Neomilitarism as Lucy wears a cropped white jacket with a black netrunner unitard with red accents over a pair of white shorts and high gray stockings, and black knee-high boots. </p>
