    <h2>Maine</h2>
    <p>Maine used to be a military soldier before he became a mercenary. Now a veteran edgerunner in Night City, Maine dreams of "making it big", although he values his friendships with his crew more than his glory.</p>
    <p>Always seeking to better himself with cyberware, Maine would make a deal with Gloria Martinez, an Emergency Medical Technician who dealt in black market implants. Before Maine's deal could be completed, Gloria would be the victim of gang violence. Maine would later get word from Lucy that his Sandevistan had been spotted on another person. Lucy would set a trap for David Martinez on Maine's behalf.</p>
