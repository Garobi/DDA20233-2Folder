    <h2>David Martinez</h2>
    <p>David Martinez was an American teenager of Latino descent. He had light brown eyes and dark brown hair that he
      wore in a quaffed hairstyle, with the sides shaved. At the start of the series, he had a thin athletic build, but
      developed a heavier build with time. David's typical style was Kitsch, sporting a black t-shirt, two golden chain
      necklaces (one with a cross), gray cropped sweatpants with two yellow straps on the sides, and white tennis shoes
      with blue straps. Later on, he started to wear his mother's yellow EMT jacket, which had a blue luminescent collar
      on the inside of the material, and a green logo painted on the back. </p>
    <p>David gradually added more implants to his body, becoming taller and more muscular. While keeping his overall
      outfit intact, he no longer wore a black shirt, preferring to remain bare-chested when not covered by the EMT
      jacket.</p>
