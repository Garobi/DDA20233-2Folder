    <h2>Faraday</h2>
    <p>Faraday was a slim, middle-aged man with gray hair. He wore a burgundy Neokitsch suit with black trim and yellow accents, black gloves, black shoes, and a white button-down shirt. His most striking features were his four cybernetic eyes, three of which were installed on the right side of his face. </p>
    <p>Faraday was a ruthless fixer who worked for Militech. He was based in Santo Domingo and often hired Maine and his crew to conduct jobs that usually involve them performing corporate espionage against Arasaka</p>
